
   Welcome to  A T H L E T I C A
   -----------------------------

The installation is now finished. Apache web server and MySQL database
are configured to start up automatically, when your computer is booted. These
links are placed in your "Startup" folder.

After the installation you are running fully functionals web and database
servers. As they are not secured against attacks from outside we highly
recommend to use this installation only in intranets.
To use it in public networks, you'll have to take further security measures.

There is also a new folder "Athletica" under Start -> Programs. There, as well
as on the desktop, you'll find links to access Athletica via your web browser.
In the same folder, we have placed some links to manually operate web browser
and database.

After starting Athletica you can reach its documentation in the
"Administration" menu, where you can also set your default language.

Apart from Athletica, preconfigured versions of following other products
have been installed. These products have their own open source licenses,
which you can find in each product subdirectory.

This distribution includes software developed by the Apache Software Foundation 
It also includes PHP, which is freely available. Check the indiviudal
web sites of hhese and all other products. They are all available there
together with their source code.
